# 🍽️ Simple Recipes Website

This is a basic website project featuring a collection of simple, classic recipes.

## 🚀 Overview

The project is built using pure HTML, focusing on clear structure and easy navigation.

## 📁 Current Recipes

The site currently features three main recipes accessible from the homepage:

* **Lasagna**
* **Mashed Potatoes** (Example shown)
* **Cranberry Sauce**

Each recipe page includes a title, a brief description, an ingredients list, and step-by-step directions.

## 🖼️ Structure Notes

* All navigation links point back to the main `index.html`.
* Recipe images are stored in an `images/` directory (e.g., `../images/mashed-potatoes.jpg`).

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To view this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
